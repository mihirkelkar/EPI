Write a function which takes a list as an input and then reverses k nodes at a time. If the list does not have nodes which are a multiple of k, the last n mod k nodes are left unchanged. 

1) Count the number of nodes in list. 

2) Start reversing k nodes by a counter. 

3) Once that is done. if count > k. Traverse k stragiht.

4) If count > k. Reverse.
