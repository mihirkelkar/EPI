You are given a sorted circular linked list and an arbitrary node in the list. All you know is that the list is sorted. 

Find the median of the values in the list. 
(Note , we need to find the median  of the values and not the median node)

Iterate till you find the smalles element. Thats your head. 
Then use the fast pointer, slow pointer technique.
