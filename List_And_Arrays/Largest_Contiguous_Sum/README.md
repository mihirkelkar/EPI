Given an array of integers, find the larget contiguous sum in the array. 


If the array is positive then the result is simply the sum of the array. 

If the array has negative numbers, then you keep a running count , if keep a running count of the current sum and the max sum. At every step we assign the maximum of the current and max sum to maxsum. Time and space complexity hasppens to be linear.
