Given n non negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining. 

For example. 

Given [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]

The idea here is to find the max height and then treat the other two parts separately 
and calculate the water that each part stores.
