Given an array of integers, find out the difference between any two elements 
such that larger element appears after the smaller number in the array. 


The naive implementation here could be using two loops and looking out for that number and keeping track. 

I better implementation would be keeping track of the minimum number found and 
keep a track of the max_diff so far. 

Lets implement both
