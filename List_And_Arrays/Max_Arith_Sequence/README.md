You are given an array of integers. Find the length of the longest arithematic sequence in the array. An arithematic sequence is contiguous array elements which are in arithematic progression. 

Ans: We iterate over the array and find the difference between the consecutive elements and keep track of the longest running count of the same difference. if current difference is different than the previous difference then we rest count
