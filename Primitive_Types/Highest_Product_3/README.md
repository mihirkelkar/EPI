Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of 
the integers

The idea here is to knowing that we'll have to deal with negative numbers and that the highest product could be a result of 2 low negative numbers. 

Keep track of the the following: 

the_highest_prod_3
highest_pod_2
lowest_prod_2
highest_number
lowest_number
