Without knowing the length of a linked list, delete the kth element from the endgiven a linked list and an integer k . 


Initiate 2 pointers. Point the first to the first element and the second to the kth element from the start. Now start advancing them both until the second pointer hits the end of the linked list. The first pointer will now be at the kth from end node
